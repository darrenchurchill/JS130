# JS130 Lesson 5

## Assignment 2 Practice Problems: Asynchronous Execution with `setTimeout`

### Question 2

In our solution to the previous problem, what do you think would happen if you
replaced `let delay` with `var delay`?

```js
function delayLog() {
  for (let delay = 1; delay <= 10; delay += 1) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(delay), delay * 1000);
  }
}

delayLog();
// => 1  // 1 second later
// => 2  // 1 second later (2 seconds after start)
// => 3  // 1 second later (3 seconds after start)
// => 4  // etc...
// => 5
// => 6
// => 7
// => 8
// => 9
// => 10
```

```js
function delayLog() {
  for (var delay = 1; delay <= 10; delay += 1) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(delay), delay * 1000);
  }
}

delayLog();
// => 11  // 1 second later
// => 11  // 1 second later (2 seconds after start)
// => 11  // 1 second later (3 seconds after start)
// => 11  // etc...
// => 11
// => 11
// => 11
// => 11
// => 11
// => 11
```

### Solution

In the first snippet, where `delay` is declared using `let`, the `delay`
variable is local to the `for` loop's block statement, and each iteration of the
loop has a different `delay` variable. Therefore, new arrow function defined and
passed to `setTimeout` has its own closure and `delay` variable separate from
the arrow functions defined in the other loop iterations.

In the second snippet, where `delay` is declared using `var`, the `delay`
variable is local to the entire `delayLog` function. So, in this case, each
iteration of the loop uses the same `delay` variable and all of the arrow
functions' closures refer to that variable. By the time `setTimeout` invokes
each of the 10 arrow functions, `delay`'s value is `11`, and so `11` is logged
10 times.
