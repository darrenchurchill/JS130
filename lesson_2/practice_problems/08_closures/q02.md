# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 8 Practice Problems: Closures

### Question 2

Let's modify our program from Question 1 little by moving the `let` statement
into the function returned by `makeCounter`. What do the 4 `console.log`
statements at the end of this program print? Try to answer without running the
code:

```js
function makeCounter() {
  return function() {
    let counter = 0;
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  }
}

let incrementCounter = makeCounter();
console.log(incrementCounter());
console.log(incrementCounter());

incrementCounter = makeCounter();
console.log(incrementCounter());
console.log(incrementCounter());
```

### Solution

```txt
1
1
1
1
```

In this example, each function `makeCounter` returns contains its own version of
the `counter` variable, created and initialized to `0` every time the returned
function is invoked.  Therefore, the `makeCounter`'s returned function itself
always returns the value `1`.
