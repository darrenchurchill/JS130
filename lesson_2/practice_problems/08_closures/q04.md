# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 8 Practice Problems: Closures

### Question 4

We'll now make some changes to how we create the output. What do the 4
`console.log` statements at the end of this program print? Try to answer without
running the code:

```js
function makeCounter() {
  let counter = 0;

  return function() {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  }
}

let incrementCounter1 = makeCounter();
let incrementCounter2 = makeCounter();

console.log(incrementCounter1());
console.log(incrementCounter1());

console.log(incrementCounter2());
console.log(incrementCounter2());
```

### Solution

```txt
1
2
1
2
```

As in the previous question, each time `makeCounter` is invoked, a new version
of the `counter` variable is created and initialized to `0`. The function
`makeCounter` returns has access to `counter` through its closure. Each time
`incrementCounter1` and `incrementCounter2` are invoked, they increment their
own `counter` variable. Therefore, the first two `console.log` statements and
the last two `console.log` statements log `1` and `2`.
