# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 8 Practice Problems: Closures

### Question 3

Let's move the variable declaration into `makeCounter` now. What do the 4
`console.log` statements at the end of this program print? Try to answer without
running the code:

```js
function makeCounter() {
  let counter = 0;

  return function() {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  }
}

let incrementCounter = makeCounter();
console.log(incrementCounter());
console.log(incrementCounter());

incrementCounter = makeCounter();
console.log(incrementCounter());
console.log(incrementCounter());
```

### Solution

```txt
1
2
1
2
```

In this example, each function `makeCounter` returns contains its own version of
the `counter` variable, created and initialized to `0` when `makeCounter` is
invoked, and contained in the returned function's closure. Therefore, when
`makeCounter`'s returned function is invoked the the first time, on line 11 and
on line 15, `counter`'s value is incremented from `0` to `1` and returned. On
the second invocation on line 12 and line 16, `counter`'s value is incremented
from `1` to `2` and returned.
