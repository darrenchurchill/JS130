# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 8 Practice Problems: Closures

### Question 7

Without running the following code, determine what value it logs on the last
line. Explain how the program arrived at that final result.

```js
function foo(start) {
  let prod = start;
  return function (factor) {
    prod *= factor;
    return prod;
  };
}

let bar = foo(2);
let result = bar(3);
result += bar(4);
result += bar(5);
console.log(result);
```

### Solution

```txt
150
```

The function `foo` takes, one argument, `start`, whose value it uses to
initialize the local variable `prod` on line 2. `foo` returns a function whose
closure contains the outer `prod` variable. Each time `foo`'s returned function,
in this case, `bar`, is invoked, `prod` is reassigned to the value of itself
multiplied by the `factor` parameter. `prod`'s new value is returned from the
function.

So, on line 9, `bar` is assigned a reference to the function whose closure
contains an outer `prod` variable with value `2`. Then, on line 10, `bar(3)`
changes `prod`'s value to be `2 * 3`, `6`, and `result` is initialized to `6`.
On line 11, `prod` is reassigned to `6 * 4`, `24`, and `result` is incremented
by `bar(4)`'s return value, to be `30`. On line 12, `prod` is reassigned to
`24 * 5`, `120`, and `result` is incremented to `30 + 120`, `150`. `150` is
logged on line 13.
