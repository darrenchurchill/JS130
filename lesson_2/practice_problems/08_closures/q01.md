# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 8 Practice Problems: Closures

### Question 1

What do the 4 `console.log` statements at the end of this program print? Try to
answer without running the code:

```js
let counter = 0;

function makeCounter() {
  return function() {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  }
}

let incrementCounter = makeCounter();
console.log(incrementCounter());
console.log(incrementCounter());

incrementCounter = makeCounter();
console.log(incrementCounter());
console.log(incrementCounter());
```

### Solution

```txt
1
2
3
4
```

In this example, there is only one version of the `counter` variable that's
declared on line 1. The 2 separate closures created by each of `makeCounter()`'s
returned functions both share a reference to the same `counter` variable.
