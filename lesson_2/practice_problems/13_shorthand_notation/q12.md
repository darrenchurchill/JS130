# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 13 Practice Problems: Shorthand Notation

### Question 12

Use destructuring to extract the `c` property of `obj` to a new variable called
`tail` and extract the remaining properties into a new object called `obj2`.

```js
const obj = { a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c' };
```

### Solution

```js
const obj = { a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c' };

const { c: tail, ...obj2 } = obj;
```
