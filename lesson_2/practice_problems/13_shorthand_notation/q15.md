# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 13 Practice Problems: Shorthand Notation

### Question 15

Use spread syntax to invoke the `prod` function with `arr` and explain what is
happening as part of your answer.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

function prod(num1, num2) {
  return num1 * num2;
}
```

### Solution

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

function prod(num1, num2) {
  return num1 * num2;
}

console.log(prod(...arr)); // => 2
```

When you invoke `prod` using the spread syntax with the array `arr`, as
`prod(...arr)`, JS invokes `prod` with 3 arguments, `arr`'s 3 elements. This is
despite `prod`'s definition with only 2 parameters. During invocation, `prod`
just ignores the extra argument value, and uses `num1 = 1` and `num2 = 2`,
returning their product, `2`.
