# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 13 Practice Problems: Shorthand Notation

### Question 16

Explain in detail what lines 7 and 8 of this code are doing.

```js
let obj = {
  foo: 'foo',
  qux: 'qux',
  bar: 'bar',
};

let obj2 = {...obj};
let { ...obj3 } = obj;
```

### Solution

On line 7, the expression `{...obj}` uses the spread syntax to expand each of
`obj`'s own enumerable property/value pairs inside of the curly braces, creating
a new object literal with the same properties and values of `obj`. `obj2` gets
initialized with a reference to that new object.

On line 8, the expression `{ ...obj3 }` uses the rest syntax within an object
destructuring assignment's curly braces to initialize a new object, referenced
by `obj3`, containing all of `obj`'s own enumerable property/value pairs.

Line 7 and line 8 have very similar end results: they create a shallow copy of
the `obj` object.
