# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: Hoisting and the `var` Statement

### Question 6

In a process called hoisting, JavaScript appears to reorganize code in such a way
that certain declarations and definitions appear to be moved around. While this
organization doesn't really occur, it's a useful mental model for understanding
scope in a JavaScript program.

Rewrite the following code in a way that shows that the code would look like if
hoisting were a real process that actually reorganized your code. The intent
here is to clearly show how and when the various identifiers in this program are
defined with respect to the code that actually gets executed.

```js
Pet.prototype.walk = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} is walking.`);
};

function Pet(name, image) {
  this.name = name;
  this.image = image;
}

class Image {
  constructor(file) {
    this.file = file;
  }
}

var catImage = new Image("cat.png");
var pudding = new Pet("Pudding", catImage);
```

### Solution

```js
function Pet(name. image) {
  this.name = name;
  this.image = image;
}

let Image;

var catImage;
var pudding;

Pet.prototype.walk = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} is walking.`);
}

Image = class {
  constructor(file) {
    this.file = file;
  }
};

catImage = new Image("cat.png");
pudding = new Pet("Pudding", catImage);
```
