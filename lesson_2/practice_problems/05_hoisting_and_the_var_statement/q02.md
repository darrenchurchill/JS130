# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: Hoisting and the `var` Statement

### Question 2

Consider the following code:

```js
for (var index = 0; index < 2; index += 1) {
  console.log(foo);
  if (index === 0) {
    var foo = "Hello";
  } else {
    foo = "Bye";
  }
}

console.log(foo);
console.log(index);
```

Without running this code, what does it print?

### Solution

```txt
undefined
Hello
Bye
2
```

During JS's creation phase, the `var index` declaration on line 1 and the `var
foo` declaration on line 4 get hoisted to the top of the current function scope,
which in this case is the beginning of this snippet. Because they have function
scope, both variables are visible everywhere in this snippet.

When the code executes, `index` is initialized with the value `0` for the first
loop iteration. `foo` hasn't been initialized yet on line 2, so its value
`undefined` gets logged. `index === 0` evaluates to `true`, so `foo` is
initialized to `"Hello"` on line 4.

`index` is then incremented to `1` for the second loop iteration. `foo`'s value
is `"Hello"`, which gets logged on line 2. `index === 0` evaluates to `false`,
so `foo` is reassigned the value `"Bye"` on line 6.

Before a possible third loop iteration, `index` is incremented to `2`, and the
`index < 2` expression evaluates to `false`, terminating the loop iteration.
`foo`'s value remains `"Bye"`.

Line 10 logs `foo`'s value `"Bye"`, and line 11 logs `index`'s value `2`.
