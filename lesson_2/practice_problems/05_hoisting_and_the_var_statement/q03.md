# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: Hoisting and the `var` Statement

### Question 3

The following code doesn't work:

```js
bar();

var bar = function() {
  console.log("foo!");
};
```

Without changing the order of the invocation and function definition, update
this code so that it works.

### Solution

```js
bar();

function bar() {
  console.log("foo!");
}
```

Variable declarations are hoisted without any initialization value, so `bar`
is `undefined` when the original snippet begins execution. However, function
declarations are hoisted along with their function body, so by changing lines
3-5 from a `var` declaration/initialization with a function expression to a
function declaration, `bar` will reference a function when execution begins.
