# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: Hoisting and the `var` Statement

### Question 1

Consider the following code:

```js
var foo = function () {
  console.log("Bye");
};

function foo() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

foo();
```

Without running this code, what will it display? Explain your reasoning.

### Solution

During JS's creation phase, it scans the code from top to bottom for variable
declarations. In this snippet, it first finds the `var foo` variable declaration
on line 1, and then finds the `function foo` function declaration on line 5.  JS
hoists variables without any initialization value, but hoists function
declarations along with the function body. Because of this, at the start of a
given function scope, a hoisted function appears to override a hoisted variable
with the same name.

At the start of this snippet, before line 1's assignment statement executes,
`foo` references the function defined on line 5. After line 1's assignment
statement executes, `foo` references the function expression on line 1.
Therefore, when `foo` is invoked on line 9, `"Bye"` is logged to the console.
