## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: Hoisting and the `var` Statement

### Question 4

Without running the following code, determine what it logs to the console:

```js
var bar = 82;
function foo() {
  var bar = bar - 42;
  console.log(bar);
}

foo();
```

### Solution

JS's creation phase executes from top to bottom of a file. In that order, it
first finds the variable `bar` declared on line 1, whose declaration is hoisted
to the top of the current function scope (the entire snippet itself). Then, JS
finds the `foo` function declaration, which is also hoisted, along with the
function body, to the top of the current function scope (also the entire
snippet). Next, JS finds a second variable `bar` inside `foo`'s definition,
which is hoisted to the top of the `foo` function scope.

Execution begins by initializing the outer `bar` variable the value `82` on
line 1. Then, `foo` is invoked on line 7. On line 3, the inner `bar` variable is
initialized with the expression `bar - 42`'s return value. When this line
executes, the current function scope is `foo`, where the inner `bar` variable
has already been declared during the creation phase.  Therefore, in the
expression `bar - 42`, `bar` is `undefined`, and the expression evaluates to
`NaN`. So, on line 4, `console.log(bar)` logs `NaN` to the console.
