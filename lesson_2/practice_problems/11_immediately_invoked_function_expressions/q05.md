## Assignment 11 Practice Problems: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

### Question 5

Is the named function inside this IIFE accessible in the global scope?

```js
(function foo() {
  console.log('Bar');
})();

foo(); // ?
```

### Solution

No, although this function is named, a function expression's name isn't
accessible in the scope that includes the function expression. You can use the
name inside the function expression, as you would in a recursive call.
