# JS130 Lesson 2

## Assignment 11 Practice Problems: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

### Question 3

The code below throws an error:

```js
var sum = 0;
sum += 10;
sum += 31;

let numbers = [1, 7, -3, 3];

function sum(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((sum, number) => {
    sum += number;
    return sum;
  }, 0);
}

sum += sum(numbers); // ?
```

Why does this code produce an error? Correct the problem by using an IIFE.

### Solution

The code produces an error because `sum` doesn't reference a function on line 14.
Both the function declaration and the `var` variable declaration use the same
name, `sum`, in this case, because of JS's hoisting rules, `sum` initially
references the function when the code begins execution, but `sum` is immediately
reassigned to `0` on line 1, and incremented twice on lines 2 and 3. Therefore,
on line 14, `sum` refers to the value `41`, not the function.

To avoid the name collision, you can turn the `sum` function into an IIFE:

```js
var sum = 0;
sum += 10;
sum += 31;

let numbers = [1, 7, -3, 3];

sum += (function(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((sum, number) => {
    sum += number;
    return sum;
  }, 0);
})(numbers);
```
