## Assignment 11 Practice Problems: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

### Question 1

Will the following code execute without error? Try to answer without running it.

```js
function() {
  console.log("Sometimes, syntax isn't intuitive!");
}();
```

### Solution

No, you can only immediately invoke function *expressions*, not function
*definitions*. The code above actually has two syntax errors:

1. `SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name`
2. `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'` (if you fix the first error by naming the
   function)
